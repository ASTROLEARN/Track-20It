üìã My Enhancement Plan

I've created a structured task list to systematically:

    Create missing pages with beautiful, functional interfaces
    Add 3D visualizations for attendance tracking and classroom management
    Build stunning analytics with interactive charts and data insights
    Implement delightful animations and micro-interactions
    Make every button functional with proper navigation and feedback
    Add gamification elements like streaks, achievements, and progress tracking
    Optimize mobile experience with touch-friendly responsive design
    Polish every detail for a premium, professional feel

The result will be a stunning, modern attendance tracking app that feels premium and delightful to use, leveraging all your existing powerful libraries (Three.js, Framer Motion, Recharts, Radix UI) to create something truly exceptional!
